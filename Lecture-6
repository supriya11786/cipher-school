Basic Commands: git init, git add, git commit, git status

Repository:
A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. It's a place where you can store your code, your files, and each file's revision history.
Branch:
A branch represents an independent line of development. Branches serve as an abstraction for the edit/stage/commit process.
Push:
The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository.
Pull request:
Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub.
merge request:
A merge request (MR) is a proposal to incorporate changes from a source branch to a target branch.
Commit:
A commit records changes to one or more files in your branch. Git assigns each commit a unique ID, called a SHA or hash.
